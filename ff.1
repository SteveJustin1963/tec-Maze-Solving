1. `PUSH` and `POP` words have an issue with pointer incrementing and decrementing. It seems you want to store two values for each push, but you increment the stack pointer by one. This might cause overlapping in the values.
2. In the `FIND-FRONT-PIXEL`, `FIND-RIGHT-PIXEL`, `FIND-BACK-PIXEL` and `FIND-LEFT-PIXEL` words, the coordinate calculations seem obscure. Since we don't know how the image is stored, it's hard to fix it exactly. However, typically images are represented in Forth as an array of width and height values followed by the pixel data. 
3. Word `PAINT` is defined inside the `MAIN-LOOP` word. It should be defined outside.
4. In the `COUNT` calculation, you're not adding the returned values from the `FIND` word calls, but replacing each time. Therefore, the `COUNT` value will be the result of the last call.
5. There are also logical issues with the `CASE` structure inside `MAIN-LOOP`. It seems that some code sections are unfinished and not logically connected. 
Without further information about the layout of the image data and the exact task the algorithm should accomplish, it's hard to give you a fully corrected code. 

Here's a simplified general version of a flood-fill algorithm in Forth:

```forth
VARIABLE STACK  \ Coordinates stack
VARIABLE SP     \ Stack pointer
VARIABLE X      \ Current X coordinate
VARIABLE Y      \ Current Y coordinate

: PUSH ( x y -- )  \ Pushes coordinates onto the stack
    SP @ 2* STACK + !  \ Store y
    X @ SP @ 2* 1+ STACK + !  \ Store x
    SP @ 1+ SP !
;

: POP ( -- x y )  \ Pops coordinates from the stack
    SP @ 1- DUP SP !  \ Decrement stack pointer
    2* STACK + @ Y !  \ Restore y
    2* 1+ STACK + @ X !  \ Restore x
;

: FLOOD-FILL ( x y color -- )  \ The flood-fill algorithm
    X !  Y !
    BEGIN
        X @ Y @ GET-COLOR
        0=  \ If the current pixel is not colored
        IF
            X @ Y @ SET-COLOR  \ Color the pixel
            X @ 1+ Y @ PUSH  \ Right
            X @ 1- Y @ PUSH  \ Left
            X @ Y @ 1+ PUSH  \ Down
            X @ Y @ 1- PUSH  \ Up
        THEN
        SP @ 0>  \ If the stack is not empty
    WHILE
        POP  \ Restore the last coordinates from the stack
    REPEAT
;
```

In this simplified version, you need to provide your own `GET-COLOR` and `SET-COLOR` words that will interact with your image data. Also, this version is for a 4-way flood fill. If you need an 8-way flood fill, you should add pushes for diagonal directions as well.

This version of the flood-fill algorithm doesn't handle image boundaries. In a practical implementation, you would have to add boundary checks to avoid accessing pixels outside the image.
